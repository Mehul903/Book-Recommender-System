# Crime & Mystery: Book-Recommendation-System

### FYI: An on-going project

As I am a huge fan of mysteries, I thought of building a Crime and Mystery book recommendation system using my knowledge in data science!

I have two data sources: 
 > 1) ~13 million book reviews from [Amazon](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html) , and 
 > 2) ~5k records of Crime and Mystery book database that I collected from [goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/11.Best_Crime_Mystery_Books).


The directory `data` contains sample data from goodreads.com (after pre-processing). The directory _**notebooks**_ contains three jupyter 
notebooks: two to collect and pre-process data and the other one to actually build a recommendation system. 

### Current state of project: 
Have a working recommendation system based on item-similarity and matrix factorization.
Working on developing a better evaluation metric.
